Script converts .pxr binary files into .vtk files, to be read e.g.
with paraview. The script should be located in 'picsar/utils/postprocessing
and the .pxr files should be contained in 'picsar/fortran_bin/RESULTS'.
For the command line options run the script with the -h option.
The script runs both with python version 2 and 3.
